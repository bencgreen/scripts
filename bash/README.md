# Bash Scripts

## Backup

To install use the following:

`curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bencgreen/scripts/master/bash/do-backup.sh > do-backup.sh | chmod +x do-backup.sh`

You also need to create file `backup-config.sh` in the same directory.  A sample config file is available to download it and edit with your details:

`curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bencgreen/scripts/master/bash/backup-config-sample.sh > backup-config.sh`
